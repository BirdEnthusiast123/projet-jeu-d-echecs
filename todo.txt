/!\ bug : root window crashes if put in background (windows 10 only, could be threading, no idea really) /!\


ia :
    value of a position
    all possible moves -> fen strings of resulting board

advantage indicator


atm board is initialized everytime moves are computed,
could store board and fen string in memory and strcmp 
the input fen string with stored string


int main()
{
	Game g;

	init_game_board(&g);

	char *fen = "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 0";
    char* fen2 = "rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4q3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1";
	parse_fen_string(&g, fen2);
	print_game(&g);
	

	free_game_board(&g);


	return 0;
}
